# Hand-Pose-Estimation
This is an OpenCV and DL based project that predicts different gestures of hand.
Specifically we have divided gestures into 10 classes and these are : 'okay', 'peace', 'thumbs up', 'thumbs down', 'call me', 'stop', 'rock', 'live long', 'fist', 'smile'

## Installing necessary libraries
Majorly 3 libraries have to be installed along with python : Tensorflow , OpenCV , Mediapipe

To install these libraries firstly we need to make sure that we have python installed in our machine.
After installing python we have to open command prompt and write the following commands to install the required libraries:
* Tensorflow : pip install tensorflow
* OpenCV : pip install opencv-python
* Mediapipe : pip install mediapipe
